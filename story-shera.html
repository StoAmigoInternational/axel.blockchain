Covers of popular songs. Music with personalized lyrics she's written herself. Even her quirky music videos. All that has attracted hundreds of thousands of YouTube subscribers.<br><br>But all those people listening to her music aren't enough to pay her rent. Ad revenues on YouTube are a pittance, and Spotify earns her less than $0.00043 a listen. Even digital downloads through iTunes swallow more than 30% of every sale - and each track is locked at $0.99 a download.<br><br>The AXEL Marketplace will remove the intermediaries between Shera and her fans, letting her set her own pricing and earn what she should be earning.<br><br>All she would have to do is select a song or album, set what she thinks it's actually worth, and get a link she can put anywhere. Using an AXEL link instead of one for iTunes would instantly boost her earnings by a huge margin with a few moments work. No more paying a fortune to the middleman - fans will finally be able to support her without jumping through hoops. AXEL will let artists like Shera reap the full benefits of their work.<br><br></p></div></div></div>
